The purpose of this project is to analyze the Netflix TV shows and movies data set to derive value so that we can visualize the content to our stakeholders in a shiny app. The data set contains 12 unique columns by 8000+ rows of observation data of TV shows and movies. After the data wrangling process, the data set was left was 5332 rows of observations which will be used for in-depth analysis and visualization. The shiny app Dashboard that I created will allow the user to select values from two pull-down lists to filter the data set. After the user selection, the dashboard will be visualizing a column graph that shows the user when the content has been released on Netflix based on the years. The dashboard will also show a data table of the selected data to allow the stakeholder to comprehend what content is on Netflix based on the user selection.
